My team took an opportunity to take part of the hackathon in 7-8 june, we did kubernetes optimization and took a second place on our take. Code is fully open source.

My contribution to the project consisted of writing the entire front and endpoints for working with Kubernetes using requests to my microservice, the microservice executed all the basic commands for interacting with Kubernetes, changing the load on pods based on AI recommendations, etc.
